# Closures Assignment

This repository contains  two JavaScript problems demonstrating the use of closures.


### 1. Counter Module Using Closures
**Objective:**  
Create a `createCounter()` function that can perform three operations:
- `increment()`: Increases the counter by 1 and prints the new value.
- `decrement()`: Decreases the counter by 1 and prints the new value.
- `getCount()`: Returns the current count value.

**Implementation Details:**
- The counter value should remain private and not be directly accessible.
- Closures are used to maintain the counter state.

### 2. Memoized Fibonacci Function Using Closures
**Objective:**  
Create a `memoizedFibonacci()` function that optimizes Fibonacci calculations using caching.

**Implementation Details:**
- A closure maintains a cache to store previously computed Fibonacci values.
- If a value is cached, it is returned directly instead of recalculating.
- The function is implemented using recursion.
